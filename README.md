# Machine Learning Canvas

The Machine Learning Canvas is a template for developing new or documenting existing predictive systems that are based on machine learning techniques. It is a visual chart with elements describing a question to predict answers to (with machine learning), objectives to reach in the application domain, ways to use predictions to reach these objectives, data sources used to learn a predictor, and performance evaluation methods.

## How to use the html canvas

The text inputs will be automatically persisted in your browser's cache. You can make a copy of the canvas.html file for every project you work on and rename it with the name of your project.

I recommend you occasionally print the html page as pdf as a backup or as a way to share what you've done with others.
